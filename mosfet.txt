RDS = Resistance between Drain / Source
5V!

Treshold (VGS / VTH). Voltage from Gate to Source
< 5V = Low Level

Power Usage:
P = RDS * I^2
(I + Total Current of all LEDs)
Look at Datasheet Limits. Heatsink or not

Temparature
P = (Max Junction Temp - Ambient) / Rja
(175c - 25c) / 62.2c/w
= 2.4 Watts

Power Usage < Temp Limit ?
